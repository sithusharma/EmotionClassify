# Emotion Recognition Software

## Overview
This Emotion Recognition Software is a Flask-based web application that utilizes advanced machine learning algorithms for real-time emotion classification from facial expressions. The software provides a simple yet powerful user interface to interact with the recognition system.

## Features
- Real-time emotion classification using a webcam feed.
- User-friendly web interface with a start button to initiate the recognition process.
- Display of emotion classification results in real-time.
- Note: The recognition process might take a while, depending on the system's performance.

## Technologies Used
- **Backend**: Flask (Python)
- **Frontend**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- **Machine Learning**: OpenCV for image processing, pre-trained CNN model for emotion classification
